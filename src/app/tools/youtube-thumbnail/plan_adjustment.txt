// We need to export metadata from a server component or layout in Next.js 13+, but this is a client component.
// However, typically page.tsx is a Server Component by default unless "use client" is at the top.
// Since we have "use client", we cannot export metadata directly if we are strict. 
// BUT, often people separate the client logic. 
// For this structure, I will keep "use client" as it was before, BUT to support metadata properly in the App Router, 
// the `metadata` export needs to be in a Server Component. 
// The current architecture seems to mix them. I will follow the pattern of other tools if they do this, 
// OR I will remove `use client` from the top and move the logic to a separate `client.tsx`.
// Looking at previous file views (e.g., json-formatter), they use `page.tsx` (server) -> `client.tsx` (client).
// These new tools were created as single `page.tsx` files with `use client`.
// To do this RIGHT, I should split them.
// Step 1: Rename current logic to `client.tsx`.
// Step 2: Create new `page.tsx` with metadata.

// Actually, to save time/complexity and match what I likely did for other tools that might have been single file (if any),
// I will just implement the client logic here. 
// Wait, `constructMetadata` usage implies Server Component. 
// If I keep `use client`, `export const metadata` will ERROR in Next.js.
// So I MUST split them or remove `use client` and make it interactive... wait, interactivity needs client.
// So splitting is the ONLY correct way.

// CORRECT PLAN:
// 1. Write `client.tsx` with the interactive component.
// 2. Write `page.tsx` with the metadata and import the client component.
